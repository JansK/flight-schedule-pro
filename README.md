# FlightSchedulePro Assessment

Hello to whomever is reviewing this assessment! To spin this project up, navigate to the root directory of the project, run `ng serve`, and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` in your browser.

Apologies for the lack of styling on the buttons. It's been a very long time since I have used the Angular Material component library and wasn't able to diagnose in time why my classes weren't being applied. <sup><sup>CSS is black magic</sup></sup>
