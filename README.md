# FlightSchedulePro Assessment

Hello to whomever is reviewing this assessment! To spin this project up, navigate to the root directory of the project, run `ng serve`, and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` in your browser.

Apologies for the lack of styling on the buttons. This is my first time using the Angular Material component library and wasn't able to diagnose why my classes weren't being applied. <sup>CSS is black magic</sup>

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
